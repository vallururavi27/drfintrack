3. **Monitor GST**: Track GST separately for business expenses if needed
4. **Track Recurring Payments**: Set up recurring transactions for regular payments like rent, EMIs, or subscriptions
5. **Reconcile Regularly**: Compare your drFinTrack balances with your actual bank statements regularly to ensure accuracy
